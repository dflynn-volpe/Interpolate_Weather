# Interpolate Weather

Example of spatial interpolation from weather station data to raster layer for grid aggregation. 

Use the RMarkdown file to run a test set of interpolations on four daily weather variables (Tmax, Tmin, Precipitation, and Snow) for a number of stations in Tennessee.

Weather station data come from the Global Historical Climatology Network via [Climate Data Online](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search).
